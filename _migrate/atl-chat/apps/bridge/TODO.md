# Bridge Features & Ideas Checklist

Check the boxes `[x]` for the features you want to include in the bridge. Once you are done, let me know and we will generate a new plan based on your selections.

**Legend:** `[x]` = wanted · `[~]` = partially implemented · `[ ]` = not started · `[-]` = not wanted

## 1. Reliability & Connection Management

- [~] **IRC Flood Control / Rate Limiting:** Token bucket algorithm to queue messages and prevent server drops.
- [~] **IRC Rate Limiting Configuration:** Support configuration options like `SendLimit` and `SendBurst`.
- [~] **Exponential Backoff Reconnection:** Reconnect to servers with increasing delays (and jitter) on network issues.
- [-] **Linear Reconnect Backoff:** Simple linear alternative (e.g., 10s, 20s, 30s) instead of exponential.
- [~] **Auto-Rejoin Logic:** Automatically attempt to rejoin IRC/XMPP channels after a `KICK`, disconnect, or ping timeout.
- [ ] **Connection Limiting:** Hard limits on total active IRC connections to prevent resource exhaustion.
- [~] **Ready Detection (PING/PONG):** Wait for `005 ISUPPORT` and a PONG response before processing messages.
- [ ] **Random IPv6 Host Selection:** Randomly pick from available IPv6 addresses for IRC servers to distribute connection load.
- [~] **Send Lock for Race Conditions:** Use `asyncio.Lock()` to serialize message sends to APIs.
- [x] **Message Queue with Delay:** Queue Discord webhook sends with configurable fixed delays to ensure strict order.
- [-] **Fixed Delay Between Messages:** Sleep before/after sending messages (simplistic rate limit).
- [~] **Async Event for Join Coordination:** Use `asyncio.Event` to prevent duplicate concurrent joins to the same channel.
- [ ] **Exit on Send Error:** Configurable behavior to exit the bridge or continue on send errors.

## 2. Security & Moderation

- [x] **AllowedMentions Configuration:** Disable `@everyone` and `@here` (and optionally role mentions) by default in Discord to prevent abuse.
- [ ] **Permission-Based Channel Joining:** Ensure IRC puppets only join channels they have permission to read/write in on Discord.
- [ ] **WebIRC Support:** Use `WEBIRC` on the IRC server so puppets show real IPs/hostnames instead of the bridge's IP.
- [ ] **Allowed/Ignored User Lists:** Whitelist or blacklist specific Discord users from being bridged.
- [ ] **IRC Hostmask Filtering:** Ignore IRC users matching specific glob patterns.
- [~] **Message Content Filtering:** Ignore Discord/IRC messages matching regex patterns.
- [ ] **Message Edit/Delete Logging:** Log all edited and deleted messages to a dedicated moderation channel with before/after comparisons.
- [~] **SASL Authentication:** Use SASL PLAIN/CAP negotiation for IRC authentication instead of standard `NickServ IDENTIFY`.
- [x] **Bot Message Filtering:** Configurable `allowBots` flag to skip bridging messages from other bots (check webhook_id/application_id).
- [ ] **Allowed Speakers Role:** Only bridge messages from Discord users who possess a specific role.

## 3. Messaging & Formatting (Bidirectional)

- [~] **Message Length Truncation:** Truncate messages over 1900 chars for Discord APIs if not splitting.
- [ ] **Multi-line Message Handling:** Split Discord messages by newlines and send each line as a separate IRC message.
- [~] **Automatic Paste Service:** Automatically upload extremely long messages (or multi-line code blocks) to a pastebin service.
- [x] **Reply Tracking & Fallback Chain:** Track cross-platform replies bidirectional. Fallback: cross-platform cache -> same-platform cache -> API fetch.
- [~] **Link Buttons for Replies:** Use Discord UI link buttons to display "Replying to..." context compactly.
- [ ] **Reply vs Forward Detection:** Distinguish between replies and forwarded messages, formatting forwards with source context.
- [ ] **Discord Thread Support:** Bridge Discord threads to XMPP threads (XEP-0201) or specific IRC topics/channels.
- [ ] **Topic Synchronization:** Sync the IRC topic or Discord channel topic with the XMPP MUC subject.
- [ ] **Private Message Support:** Bridge PMs between XMPP/IRC users and Discord users.
- [ ] **Auto-Creating PM Channels:** Dynamically create a Discord channel for each IRC private message (query window).

## 4. Mentions & Anti-Ping

- [ ] **Zero-Width Space (ZWS) Anti-Ping:** Insert `\u200B` in nicknames to prevent accidental highlighting.

- [~] **Cross-Platform Mention Conversion:** Convert Discord `<@id>` to IRC `@nickname`, and IRC `@nickname` to Discord `<@id>`.
- [~] **Markdown Escaping for IRC Nicks:** Escape Discord markdown characters in IRC nicknames so they don't break formatting.
- [~] **IRC Nickname Normalization:** Replace conflicting characters (`!` to `ǃ`, `@` to `＠`) in nicknames.

- [~] **Nickname Suffix and Separator:** Configure fixed suffixes (e.g. `[d]` or `_d`) for bridged nicknames.
- [x] **Nick Length Validation:** Ensure webhook usernames are strictly 2-32 chars (pad short ones, truncate long ones).
- [-] **Username Truncation with Discriminator:** Truncate appropriately while keeping the old #discriminator logic if needed.

## 5. Media, Embeds & Avatars

- [x] **Webhook Avatar Caching with TTL:** Cache Discord avatar URLs with a Time-To-Live to avoid hitting rate limits.

- [ ] **Configurable Avatar URL Template:** Allow user config to define the avatar URL format string.
- [~] **Embed Translation & Extraction:** Extract media (like Tenor GIFs) from embeds and bridge them as raw URLs/attachments.
- [ ] **Embed Suppression:** Use `suppress_embeds=True` on Discord to prevent URL previews.
- [~] **Embed Count Indicator:** Append "(N embeds)" text to messages containing embeds.
- [ ] **Media Link Embedding:** Send standalone media URLs (images/videos) on a separate line so Discord embeds them nicely.
- [x] **XMPP VCard Avatars:** Fetch avatar hashes and images via XMPP VCards for bridged users.
- [ ] **Avatar Dominant Color Extraction:** Extract dominant color from avatar to use in Discord webhook embeds.
- [ ] **Attachment URL Appending:** Append uploaded file URLs to the end of the text message.

## 6. Puppets & Multi-Presence

## High Priority (Reliability)

### IRC Flood Control

**Status:** Not implemented
**Priority:** High
**Source:** Matterbridge audit, Biboumi audit

**What it does:**

- Message queue with configurable delay between sends
- Prevents rate limiting and connection drops
- Token bucket algorithm for rate limiting

**Biboumi implementation:**

- Token bucket: 1 token per second refill
- Default limit: 10 messages
- Messages queued when tokens exhausted
- Per-server configurable limit
- Can bypass throttling for critical messages (PING/PONG)

**Implementation:**

```python
# Add to IRC adapter
class TokenBucket:
    def __init__(self, limit: int, refill_rate: float = 1.0):
        self.limit = limit
        self.tokens = limit
        self.refill_rate = refill_rate
        self.last_refill = time.time()
    
    def use_token(self) -> bool:
        self._refill()
        if self.tokens > 0:
            self.tokens -= 1
            return True
        return False
    
    def _refill(self):
        now = time.time()
        elapsed = now - self.last_refill
        self.tokens = min(self.limit, self.tokens + elapsed * self.refill_rate)
        self.last_refill = now

# In IRC adapter
message_queue: asyncio.Queue
tokens_bucket: TokenBucket
```

**Config:**

```yaml
irc_throttle_limit: 10  # messages per second
irc_message_queue: 30   # max queue size
```

### IRC Rejoin Logic

**Status:** Not implemented
**Priority:** High
**Source:** Matterbridge audit, Biboumi audit

**What it does:**

- Automatic rejoin after KICK
- Automatic rejoin on disconnect/ping timeout
- Configurable rejoin delay

**Biboumi status:**

- Tracks channels to join but NO automatic rejoin after KICK
- Marks channel as not joined but doesn't attempt rejoin
- Opportunity for improvement over biboumi

**Implementation:**

```python
async def handle_kick(self, channel: str, reason: str):
    # Don't rejoin if banned
    if "ban" in reason.lower():
        return
    
    await asyncio.sleep(self.rejoin_delay)
    await self.join(channel)

async def on_disconnect(self):
    # Rejoin all channels we were in
    for channel in self.joined_channels:
        await asyncio.sleep(self.rejoin_delay)
        await self.join(channel)
```

**Config:**

```yaml
irc_rejoin_delay: 5  # seconds
irc_auto_rejoin: true
```

### Nick Sanitization

**Status:** Not implemented
**Priority:** High
**Source:** Matterbridge audit

**What it does:**

- Sanitize Discord usernames for IRC compatibility
- Replace special characters (@#:/) with safe alternatives
- Prevent IRC command injection

**Biboumi status:**

- Not needed in biboumi (uses XMPP JIDs, not Discord usernames)
- ATL Bridge needs this due to puppet model using Discord names directly

**Implementation:**

```python
def sanitize_nick(nick: str) -> str:
    # Remove/replace IRC special chars
    nick = re.sub(r'[@#:/\\]', '-', nick)
    # Truncate to IRC nick limit (typically 9-30 chars)
    nick = nick[:30]
    # Strip/transliterate Unicode/emoji
    nick = unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', nick).encode('ascii', 'ignore').decode()
    return nick or "user"  # fallback if empty
```

### Connection Backoff

**Status:** Partial (Portal client has retry)
**Priority:** High
**Source:** Matterbridge audit, Biboumi audit

**What it does:**

- Exponential backoff for IRC/XMPP reconnects
- Prevents connection spam on network issues
- Configurable min/max backoff times

**Biboumi implementation:**

- Fixed 2-second delay for XMPP reconnection
- Port fallback for IRC (tries next port on failure)
- No exponential backoff or jitter
- No max retry limit

**Implementation:**

```python
from tenacity import retry, wait_exponential

**Implementation:**
```python
from tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt
import random

@retry(
    wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=2, max=60),
    stop=stop_after_attempt(10)
)
async def connect(self):
    # Add jitter to prevent thundering herd
    jitter = random.uniform(0.5, 1.5)
    await asyncio.sleep(jitter)
    ...
```

## Medium Priority (Features)

### IRC Channel Keys

**Status:** Not implemented
**Priority:** Medium
**Source:** Matterbridge audit, Biboumi audit

**What it does:**

- Support password-protected IRC channels
- Per-channel key configuration

**Biboumi implementation:**

- Full support with batched JOIN commands
- Handles multiple channels with different keys
- Proper error handling (475 ERR_BADCHANNELKEY)
- Sends: `JOIN #chan1,#chan2 key1,key2`

**Config:**

```yaml
mappings:
  - discord_channel_id: "123"
    irc:
      server: "irc.libera.chat"
      channel: "#private"
      key: "password123"
```

**Implementation:**

```python
# Store keys securely, handle 475 numeric
async def join_channel(self, channel: str, key: str = ""):
    if key:
        await self.send(f"JOIN {channel} {key}")
    else:
        await self.send(f"JOIN {channel}")
```

### SASL Authentication

**Status:** Not implemented (using NickServ IDENTIFY)
**Priority:** Medium
**Source:** Matterbridge audit, Biboumi audit

**What it does:**

- More secure IRC authentication
- No password in plaintext IDENTIFY command
- Alternative to NickServ

**Biboumi implementation:**

- Full SASL PLAIN support with CAP negotiation
- Graceful fallback on failure
- Per-server credential storage
- State machine: unneeded → needed → success/failure

**CAP negotiation flow:**

1. Send `CAP REQ :sasl`
2. Server responds `CAP ACK :sasl`
3. Send `AUTHENTICATE PLAIN`
4. Server responds `AUTHENTICATE +`
5. Send base64(`\0username\0password`)
6. Server responds `903` (success) or `904` (failure)
7. Send `CAP END`

**Config:**

```yaml
irc_use_sasl: true
irc_sasl_user: "username"
irc_sasl_password: "password"
```

### Verbose Join/Part

**Status:** Partial (basic join/part)
**Priority:** Low
**Source:** Matterbridge audit

**What it does:**

- Include ident@host in presence messages
- More detailed join/part notifications

**Config:**

```yaml
verbose_join_part: true  # "user (ident@host) joins"
```

## Future XEP Implementations

### XEP-0394: Message Markup

**Status:** Deferred - needs investigation

**What it does:**

- Semantic markup for bold, italic, code, quotes, lists
- Uses character position ranges instead of Markdown syntax
- Example: `<span start="6" end="11"><emphasis/></span>` for bold text

**Why deferred:**

- Complex bidirectional conversion between Discord Markdown and positional markup
- Requires parsing `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``, `> quote` and calculating offsets
- Breaks on edits (positions shift)
- Most XMPP clients already render Markdown
- High implementation complexity for marginal UX improvement

**Implementation notes if revisited:**

- Need robust Markdown parser for Discord → XMPP
- Need to reconstruct Markdown from position spans for XMPP → Discord
- Handle nested formatting, Unicode, emojis correctly
- Consider using existing Markdown library (e.g., `markdown-it-py`)
- Test with complex messages (mixed formatting, mentions, links)

**Dependencies:**

- `xep_0030` (Service Discovery)
- `xep_0071` (XHTML-IM) - deprecated, may need alternative approach

## Slidcord Implementation Patterns

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Source:** [slidcord](https://codeberg.org/nicoco/slidcord) - Python Discord-XMPP gateway (slidge-based)

### Implementation Patterns to Adopt

1. **✅ Message Echo Prevention**
   - Track sent message IDs in `ignore_next_msg_event` set
   - Prevents duplicate messages from own sends
   - Implementation: `self.ignore_next_msg_event.add(msg.id)` before send
   - **Status:** We already handle this differently (check author ID)

2. **✅ Send Lock for Race Conditions**
   - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to serialize message sends
   - Prevents interleaved messages and API race conditions
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     self.send_lock = asyncio.Lock()
     async with self.send_lock:
         msg = await channel.send(text)
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Add to Discord adapter
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes

3. **✅ Guild Member Lazy Loading**
   - Fetch guild members on-demand with lock
   - Cache fetched guild IDs to prevent duplicate fetches
   - Rate limiting awareness (don't fetch for large guilds by default)
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     self.guild_members_fetch_lock = asyncio.Lock()
     self.guild_members_fetched: set[int] = set()
     
     async with self.guild_members_fetch_lock:
         if guild.id not in self.guild_members_fetched:
             await guild.fetch_members(cache=True)
             self.guild_members_fetched.add(guild.id)
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - We use webhooks, don't need full member list
   - **Effort:** 1 hour if needed

4. **⚠️ Discord Thread Support**
   - Map Discord threads to XMPP threads
   - Handle thread creation/rename events
   - Thread-aware message routing
   - **Status:** Not implemented
   - **Priority:** Medium - Useful for busy channels
   - **Effort:** 3-4 hours
   - **Implementation notes:**
     - Store thread_id in MessageIn/MessageOut events
     - IRC: Use thread name as channel topic or separate channel
     - XMPP: Use XEP-0201 (Best Practices for Message Threads)

5. **✅ Embed Extraction**
   - Extract Tenor GIFs from Discord embeds
   - Send as attachments instead of URLs
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     for embed in message.embeds:
         if embed.provider.name == "Tenor":
             attachments.append(Attachment(url=embed.video.url))
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Nice-to-have
   - **Effort:** 1 hour

6. **✅ Reply vs Forward Detection**
   - Distinguish between Discord replies and forwarded messages
   - Format forwarded messages with source context
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     if message.type != MessageType.reply and reply_to is not None:
         # This is a forwarded message
         text = f"↱ Forwarded from {source}\n> {quoted_text}"
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Edge case
   - **Effort:** 2 hours

7. **✅ Rate Limiting Awareness**
   - Don't auto-fetch profiles for non-friends (triggers rate limits)
   - Configurable member fetching for large guilds
   - Graceful degradation when rate limited
   - **Priority:** Medium - Important for large servers
   - **Effort:** Already handled by discord.py rate limiting

### Recommended Additions to ATL Bridge

**Immediate:**

- Add send lock to Discord adapter (30 min)

**Short-term:**

- Discord thread support (3-4 hours)
- Embed extraction for Tenor GIFs (1 hour)

**Long-term:**

- Reply vs forward detection (2 hours)
- Guild member lazy loading if needed (1 hour)

**Total estimated effort:** 5-6 hours for immediate + short-term features

## Black-Hole Implementation Patterns

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Source:** [black-hole](https://github.com/slice/black-hole) - Python XMPP-Discord bridge

### Implementation Patterns to Adopt

1. **✅ Message Queue with Delay**
   - Queue XMPP→Discord messages to preserve order
   - Configurable delay between webhook sends (default: 0.25s)
   - Background consumer processes queue with `asyncio.Event`
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     self._queue = []
     self._incoming = asyncio.Event()
     
     async def _sender(self):
         while True:
             await self._incoming.wait()
             for job in self._queue:
                 await self.session.post(webhook_url, json=payload)
                 await asyncio.sleep(self.config["delay"])
             self._queue.clear()
             self._incoming.clear()
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Ensures message order
   - **Effort:** 2 hours
   - **Note:** We already use webhooks, this adds ordering guarantee

2. **✅ Avatar Caching with TTL**
   - Cache Discord avatar URLs with timestamp-based invalidation
   - Default: 30 minutes (1800s)
   - Uses `time.monotonic()` for stable timing
   - Prevents rate limiting from repeated avatar fetches
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     self._avatar_cache = {}  # { user_id: (invalidation_ts, avatar_url) }
     
     async def _get_from_cache(self, user_id: int):
         current = time.monotonic()
         cache_period = 30 * 60  # 30 minutes
         invalidation_ts = current + cache_period
         
         value = self._avatar_cache.get(user_id)
         if value is None:
             user = await self.client.fetch_user(user_id)
             avatar_url = str(user.avatar_url_as(format="png"))
             self._avatar_cache[user_id] = (invalidation_ts, avatar_url)
             return avatar_url
         
         user_ts, avatar_url = value
         if current > user_ts:
             self._avatar_cache.pop(user_id)
             return await self._get_from_cache(user_id)
         return avatar_url
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - We already cache avatars, but no TTL
   - **Effort:** 1 hour to add TTL invalidation
   - **Status:** Partial - We have MD5-based cache, add time-based invalidation

3. **✅ Message ID Store for Edits**
   - Store `(jid, xmpp_message_id) -> discord_message_id` mapping
   - Uses `ExpiringDict` with 1-hour TTL and 1000 message limit
   - Enables PATCH webhook for edits instead of new POST
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     from expiringdict import ExpiringDict
     
     self._message_id_store = ExpiringDict(max_len=1000, max_age_seconds=3600)
     
     # On send
     store_key = (author_jid, xmpp_message_id)
     lookup_key = (author_jid, original_xmpp_message_id)
     
     if original_xmpp_message_id and lookup_key in self._message_id_store:
         discord_message_id = self._message_id_store[lookup_key]
         await session.patch(f"{webhook_url}/messages/{discord_message_id}", json=payload)
     else:
         resp = await session.post(webhook_url, json=payload)
         discord_message = await resp.json()
         self._message_id_store[store_key] = discord_message["id"]
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Better than our current approach
   - **Effort:** 2-3 hours
   - **Status:** We track message IDs but don't use webhook PATCH for edits

4. **✅ Mention Sanitization**
   - Strip/escape @everyone and @here mentions
   - Convert user/role mentions to non-mentioning format
   - Prevents mention abuse from XMPP side
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def clean_content(content: str) -> str:
         content = content.replace("@everyone", "@\u200beveryone")
         content = content.replace("@here", "@\u200bhere")
         content = re.sub(r"<@[!&]?(\d+)>", lambda m: m.group(0).strip("<>"), content)
         return content
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Security/anti-abuse
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

5. **✅ Nick Length Validation**
   - Ensure webhook usernames are 2-32 characters
   - Pad short nicks: `<x>` for single-char nicks
   - Truncate long nicks to 32 chars
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def ensure_valid_nick(nick: str) -> str:
         if len(nick) < 2:
             return f"<{nick}>"
         if len(nick) > 32:
             return nick[:32]
         return nick
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Prevents webhook errors
   - **Effort:** 15 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

6. **✅ Message Length Truncation**
   - Truncate messages over 1900 chars with "... (trimmed)"
   - Prevents Discord API errors (2000 char limit)
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     if len(content) > 1900:
         content = content[:1900] + "... (trimmed)"
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better than silent failure
   - **Effort:** 15 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented (we should split instead)

7. **✅ Attachment URL Appending**
   - Append attachment URLs to message content
   - Simple approach: just add URLs separated by spaces
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     if message.attachments:
         urls = " ".join(attachment.proxy_url for attachment in message.attachments)
         content += " " + urls
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - We already handle attachments better
   - **Effort:** N/A
   - **Status:** We use proper file uploads

8. **✅ Embed Count Indicator**
   - Add "(N embeds)" to message when embeds present
   - Simple notification that embeds exist
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     if message.embeds:
         s = "" if len(message.embeds) == 1 else "s"
         content += f" ({len(message.embeds)} embed{s})"
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Nice-to-have
   - **Effort:** 15 minutes

### Recommended Additions to ATL Bridge

**Immediate (High Priority):**

1. Mention sanitization - Prevent @everyone/@here abuse (30 min)
2. Avatar cache TTL - Add time-based invalidation (1 hour)
3. Message ID store for webhook edits - Use PATCH instead of new messages (2-3 hours)

**Short-term (Medium Priority):**
4. Message queue with delay - Preserve message order (2 hours)
5. Nick length validation - Prevent webhook errors (15 min)
6. Message length handling - Split or truncate (30 min)

**Long-term (Low Priority):**
7. Embed count indicator (15 min)

**Total estimated effort:** 6-8 hours for immediate + short-term features

### Key Insights from Black-Hole

**Strengths:**

- Simple, focused implementation (8 files, ~500 LOC)
- Effective use of asyncio primitives (Event, Queue pattern)
- Smart caching with TTL to avoid rate limits
- Webhook PATCH for edits (better than reposting)

**Weaknesses:**

- No retry logic or error recovery
- Truncates long messages instead of splitting
- No IRC support (XMPP-Discord only)
- Limited XEP support

**Best practices to adopt:**

- Use `time.monotonic()` for cache invalidation (more stable than `time.time()`)
- Queue messages with delay for ordering guarantees
- PATCH webhook messages for edits (requires storing webhook URL + message ID)
- Sanitize mentions before sending to Discord

## Revcord Implementation Patterns

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Source:** [revcord](https://github.com/mayudev/revcord) - TypeScript Discord-Revolt bridge

### Implementation Patterns to Adopt

1. **✅ Cross-Platform Reply Tracking**
   - Separate caches for each direction: `discordCache` and `revoltCache`
   - Track original message ID, author, created message ID, channel
   - Enables cross-platform reply threading
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     @dataclass
     class CachedMessage:
         parent_message: str  # Original message ID
         parent_author: str   # Original author ID
         created_message: str # Bridged message ID
         channel_id: str      # Channel ID
     
     discord_cache: list[CachedMessage] = []
     xmpp_cache: list[CachedMessage] = []
     
     # When bridging reply from Discord to XMPP
     cross_platform_ref = next(
         (c for c in xmpp_cache if c.created_message == reply_to_id),
         None
     )
     if cross_platform_ref:
         # Reply to the original XMPP message
         reply_to = cross_platform_ref.parent_message
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Enables proper reply threading
   - **Effort:** 2-3 hours
   - **Status:** We track message IDs but not bidirectionally

2. **✅ Reply Fallback Chain**
   - Try cross-platform cache first
   - Fall back to same-platform cache
   - Final fallback: fetch message from API
   - Graceful degradation if fetch fails
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     # 1. Check cross-platform cache
     cross_ref = find_in_cache(other_platform_cache, reply_id)
     if cross_ref:
         return cross_ref.parent_message
     
     # 2. Check same-platform cache
     same_ref = find_in_cache(same_platform_cache, reply_id)
     if same_ref:
         return same_ref.created_message
     
     # 3. Fetch from API
     try:
         original = await channel.fetch_message(reply_id)
         return format_reply_embed(original)
     except NotFound:
         return "[message not found]"
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better UX for replies
   - **Effort:** 1-2 hours

3. **✅ Username Truncation with Discriminator**
   - Truncate to 32 chars for webhook usernames
   - Include discriminator only if not new username system
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def format_username(username: str, discriminator: str) -> str:
         # New username system has discriminator "0"
         if len(discriminator) == 1:
             return username[:32]
         return f"{username}#{discriminator}"[:32]
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Discord removed discriminators
   - **Effort:** 15 minutes
   - **Status:** Not needed (Discord changed system)

4. **✅ Embed Translation**
   - Convert Discord embeds to target platform format
   - Only allow embeds from bots (security)
   - Graceful failure if translation fails
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     if message.embeds and message.author.bot:
         try:
             translated_embed = translate_embed(message.embeds[0])
             message_object["embeds"] = [translated_embed]
         except Exception as e:
             log.warning("Failed to translate embed: %s", e)
             # Continue without embed
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better embed support
   - **Effort:** 3-4 hours
   - **Status:** We extract some embeds (Tenor), not full translation

5. **✅ Attachment URL Concatenation**
   - Append all attachment URLs to message content
   - Simple newline-separated list
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     message_string = content + "\n"
     for attachment in attachments:
         message_string += attachment.url + "\n"
     message_string = message_string.rstrip("\n")
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - We handle attachments better
   - **Effort:** N/A
   - **Status:** We use proper file uploads

6. **✅ Bot Message Filtering**
   - Configurable per-channel bot message bridging
   - `allowBots` flag in channel mapping
   - Skip messages from own bot application
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     if target and message.application_id != bot.user.id:
         if not message.author.bot or target.allow_bots:
             # Bridge the message
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Prevents bot loops
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Status:** We check webhook_id, add application_id check

7. **✅ Emoji Limit for Spam Prevention**
   - Limit displayed custom emojis to 5
   - Prevents emoji spam/bombing
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     emojis = re.findall(EMOJI_PATTERN, content)
     for i, emoji in enumerate(emojis):
         if i < 5:  # Limit to 5 emojis
             emoji_url = f"https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/{emoji_id}.webp"
             content = content.replace(emoji, f"[:{emoji_name}:]({emoji_url})")
         else:
             content = content.replace(emoji, f":{emoji_name}:")
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Anti-spam measure
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes

8. **✅ SQLite Persistence**
   - Store channel mappings in SQLite database
   - Sequelize ORM for easy management
   - Auto-sync schema on startup
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     # Using SQLAlchemy or similar
     class Mapping(Base):
         __tablename__ = "mappings"
         id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
         discord_channel = Column(String)
         xmpp_muc = Column(String)
         irc_channel = Column(String)
         allow_bots = Column(Boolean, default=True)
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better than YAML for dynamic mappings
   - **Effort:** 2-3 hours
   - **Status:** We use YAML config, consider DB for dynamic mappings

### Recommended Additions to ATL Bridge

**Immediate (High Priority):**

1. Cross-platform reply tracking - Bidirectional cache (2-3 hours)
2. Bot message filtering - Add application_id check (1 hour)

**Short-term (Medium Priority):**
3. Reply fallback chain - Better reply handling (1-2 hours)
4. Embed translation - Full embed support (3-4 hours)
5. SQLite persistence - Dynamic channel mappings (2-3 hours)

**Long-term (Low Priority):**
6. Emoji limit - Spam prevention (30 min)

**Total estimated effort:** 9-13 hours for immediate + short-term features

### Key Insights from Revcord

**Strengths:**

- Bidirectional message caching for cross-platform replies
- Graceful fallback chain for reply resolution
- Per-channel bot filtering configuration
- SQLite persistence for dynamic mappings
- Emoji spam prevention

**Weaknesses:**

- No rate limiting or throttling
- No retry logic
- TypeScript (not Python, harder to adapt)
- Revolt-specific (not IRC/XMPP)

**Best practices to adopt:**

- Separate caches for each bridge direction
- Three-tier fallback for reply resolution (cache → cache → API)
- Per-channel configuration flags (allow_bots, etc.)
- Database persistence for dynamic configuration
- Limit custom emoji display to prevent spam

## CatPuppetBridge Implementation Patterns

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Source:** [CatPuppetBridge](https://github.com/hypatia-software-org/CatPuppetBridge) - Python IRC-Discord bridge with puppets

### Implementation Patterns to Adopt

1. **✅ WebIRC Integration**
   - Use WebIRC for enhanced security and proper hostname display
   - Prevents impersonation and shows real Discord user info
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     connection.send_raw(
         f"WEBIRC {password} {hostname} {hostname} {ip_address}"
     )
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Better security and UX
   - **Effort:** 1-2 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented - we use standard IRC connection

2. **✅ Permission-Based Channel Joining**
   - Puppets only join channels they have Discord permissions for
   - Dynamic join/part based on role changes
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     async def accessible_channels(self, user_id):
         channels = []
         for channel_id in mapped_channels:
             channel = self.get_channel(channel_id)
             member = channel.guild.get_member(user_id)
             if channel.permissions_for(member).read_messages:
                 channels.append(channel_id)
         return channels
     
     # On role change
     async def on_member_update(self, before, after):
         if before.roles != after.roles:
             channels = await self.accessible_channels(after.id)
             await send_command(after, 'join_part', channels)
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Respects Discord permissions
   - **Effort:** 2-3 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented - puppets join all mapped channels

3. **✅ AFK/UNAFK Status Management**
   - Set IRC AWAY status based on Discord presence
   - Automatic AFK when offline/DND, UNAFK when online/idle
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     async def on_presence_update(self, before, after):
         previously_inactive = before.status in (Status.offline, Status.dnd)
         now_active = after.status in (Status.online, Status.idle)
         
         if previously_inactive and now_active:
             await send_irc_command(after, 'unafk')
         elif previously_active and now_inactive:
             await send_irc_command(after, 'afk')
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Nice UX feature
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Status:** Not implemented

4. **✅ IRC Message Splitting**
   - Calculate reserved bytes for IRC protocol overhead
   - Split at word boundaries when possible
   - Respect 512 byte IRC message limit
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def msg_reserved_bytes(self, target, nickname, hostname):
         # :<nick>!<nick>@<host> PRIVMSG <target> :\r\n
         msg = f":<{nickname}>!<{nickname}>@<{hostname}> PRIVMSG <{target}> :"
         return len(msg.encode("utf8")) + 4  # +CRLF
     
     def split_irc_message(self, message, target):
         max_bytes = 512 - self.msg_reserved_bytes(target)
         lines = []
         message = re.sub(r'[\r\n]+', '', message)  # Strip newlines
         
         while len(message[:max_bytes]) != 0:
             chunk = message[:max_bytes]
             
             # Don't split mid-word
             if len(chunk) + 1 < len(message):
                 if not (message[len(chunk)] == ' ' or message[len(chunk)-1] == ' '):
                     chunk = chunk.rsplit(" ", 1)[0]
             
             lines.append(chunk)
             message = message[len(chunk):].lstrip()
         return lines
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Prevents message truncation
   - **Effort:** 2 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented - we should split instead of truncate

5. **✅ Puppet Lifecycle Management**
   - Activate puppet on first message or presence change
   - Deactivate puppet when user leaves guild
   - Track active puppets in memory
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     active_puppets: set[int] = set()
     
     async def activate_puppet(self, user):
         channels = await self.accessible_channels(user.id)
         await send_irc_command(user, 'active', channels)
         self.active_puppets.add(user.id)
     
     async def on_member_remove(self, member):
         if member.id in self.active_puppets:
             self.active_puppets.remove(member.id)
             await send_irc_command(member, 'die')
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better resource management
   - **Effort:** 1-2 hours
   - **Status:** Partial - we have idle timeout, not guild leave detection

6. **✅ IRC-Safe Nickname Generation**
   - Strip non-IRC-safe characters
   - Ensure first character is letter or special char
   - Truncate to fit IRC limits with display name + username
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def irc_safe_nickname(self, nickname: str) -> str:
         allowed_special = r"\[\]\\`_^{|}"
         nickname = nickname.strip()
         
         # First char must be letter or special
         first_char = nickname[0]
         if not re.match(r"[A-Za-z" + allowed_special + "]", first_char):
             nickname = "_" + nickname[1:]
         
         # Remove invalid chars
         valid_nick = re.sub(r"[^A-Za-z0-9" + allowed_special + "]", "", nickname)
         return valid_nick
     
     async def generate_irc_nickname(self, user):
         username = self.irc_safe_nickname(user.name)
         display_name = self.irc_safe_nickname(user.display_name)
         
         # Format: DisplayName[username]_suffix
         reserved = 2 + len(suffix)  # [] + suffix
         max_len = 30
         
         if len(display_name) + len(username) + reserved > max_len:
             # Truncate username first, then display name
             ...
         
         return f"{display_name}[{username}]{suffix}"
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Prevents IRC errors
   - **Effort:** 1-2 hours
   - **Status:** Partial - we sanitize but not as thoroughly

7. **✅ Exponential Backoff Reconnection**
   - Retry with increasing delays: 10s, 20s, 30s... up to 300s (5 min)
   - Automatic reconnection on disconnect
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def connect_and_retry(self, server, port, nickname, tls=False):
         retry_count = 1
         while True:
             try:
                 self.connection = self.reactor.server().connect(
                     server, port, nickname, connect_factory=ssl_factory if tls else None
                 )
                 break
             except (ServerConnectionError, TimeoutError):
                 delay = min(10 * retry_count, 300)
                 log.warning('Connection failed %d times, retrying in %ds', retry_count, delay)
                 retry_count += 1
                 time.sleep(delay)
         
         self.connection.add_global_handler("disconnect", self.on_disconnect)
     
     def on_disconnect(self, c, e):
         self.connect_and_retry(self.server, self.port, self.nickname, self.tls)
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Better reliability
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Status:** Not implemented - we should add this

8. **✅ Queue-Based Command Processing**
   - Separate queues for different message types
   - Worker threads process queues asynchronously
   - Commands: send, afk, unafk, nick, join_part, send_dm, die
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     queues = {
         'in_queue': Queue(),      # Discord → IRC
         'out_queue': Queue(),     # IRC → Discord
         'puppet_queue': Queue(),  # Puppet commands
         'dm_out_queue': Queue()   # DMs
     }
     
     def process_discord_queue(self):
         for msg in iter(self.queues['in_queue'].get, sentinel):
             match msg['command']:
                 case 'send':
                     self.do_send(msg)
                 case 'afk':
                     self.connection.send_raw("AWAY :Away")
                 case 'unafk':
                     self.connection.send_raw("AWAY")
                 case 'nick':
                     self.connection.nick(msg['irc_nick'])
                 case 'join_part':
                     self.join_part(msg['data'])
                 case 'die':
                     self.end('has left discord')
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better architecture
   - **Effort:** 3-4 hours
   - **Status:** We use event bus, not queues

9. **✅ Robohash Avatar Generation**
   - Generate random avatars for IRC users without Discord accounts
   - Use robohash.org for consistent avatar generation
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def get_avatar_url(self, irc_nick, discord_users):
         # Check if IRC nick matches Discord user
         for user in discord_users:
             if user.name.lower() == irc_nick.lower():
                 return user.avatar.url
         
         # Generate robohash avatar
         return f"https://robohash.org/{irc_nick}.png"
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Nice-to-have
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** We use Portal for avatars

### Recommended Additions to ATL Bridge

**Immediate (High Priority):**

1. WebIRC integration - Better security (1-2 hours)
2. Permission-based channel joining - Respect Discord perms (2-3 hours)
3. IRC message splitting - Proper 512 byte handling (2 hours)
4. IRC-safe nickname generation - Prevent errors (1-2 hours)
5. Exponential backoff reconnection - Better reliability (1 hour)

**Short-term (Medium Priority):**
6. AFK/UNAFK status management - Better UX (1 hour)
7. Puppet lifecycle management - Resource efficiency (1-2 hours)
8. Queue-based command processing - Better architecture (3-4 hours)

**Long-term (Low Priority):**
9. Robohash avatar fallback (30 min)

**Total estimated effort:** 12-17 hours for immediate + short-term features

### Key Insights from CatPuppetBridge

**Strengths:**

- WebIRC for enhanced security and proper hostnames
- Permission-aware puppet joining (unique feature)
- Proper IRC message splitting with word boundary detection
- Exponential backoff with reasonable max delay (5 min)
- AFK/UNAFK based on Discord presence
- Queue-based architecture for command processing

**Weaknesses:**

- Threading instead of asyncio (less efficient)
- No rate limiting or flood control
- No message ID tracking for edits/deletes
- Limited error recovery

**Best practices to adopt:**

- WebIRC for all puppet connections
- Check Discord permissions before joining IRC channels
- Calculate IRC protocol overhead for accurate message splitting
- Exponential backoff with max delay cap
- Track puppet lifecycle (activate on first use, deactivate on leave)
- IRC-safe nickname generation with proper character filtering

## Chat-Bridge (Dolphin) Implementation Patterns

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Source:** [chat-bridge](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/chat-bridge) - Python IRC-Discord bridge for Dolphin project

### Implementation Patterns to Adopt

1. **✅ Zero-Width Space Ping Prevention**
   - Insert `\ufeff` (zero-width space) after first character
   - Prevents accidental pings when relaying names
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def sanitize_name(self, name):
         # Insert a zero-width space to prevent accidental pings on IRC
         return name[0] + "\ufeff" + name[1:]
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Prevents ping spam
   - **Effort:** 15 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

2. **✅ Smart IRC Nick Sanitization**
   - Full word matching algorithm (from Textual IRC client)
   - Handles `[nick]` passthrough for intentional pings
   - Word boundary detection to avoid false matches
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def sanitize_irc_names(self, text, nicks):
         # Sort by length to match "OatmealDome" before "Oatmeal"
         sorted_nicks = sorted([n for n in nicks if n], key=len, reverse=True)
         
         # Pattern: "[nick]" (group 1) or "nick" (group 2)
         nicks_pattern = "|".join(map(re.escape, sorted_nicks))
         full_pattern = re.compile(
             f"\\[({nicks_pattern})\\]|({nicks_pattern})", re.IGNORECASE
         )
         
         def replacement_callback(match):
             # [nick] = passthrough ping
             if match.group(1):
                 return match.group(1)
             
             found_str = match.group(2)
             start, end = match.span(2)
             
             # Check word boundaries
             if found_str[0].isalnum():
                 if start > 0 and text[start - 1].isalnum():
                     return found_str  # Not a word boundary
             
             if found_str[-1].isalnum():
                 if end < len(text) and text[end].isalnum():
                     return found_str  # Not a word boundary
             
             # Match found, sanitize
             return self.sanitize_name(found_str)
         
         return full_pattern.sub(replacement_callback, text)
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Sophisticated ping prevention
   - **Effort:** 2 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented

3. **✅ Reply/Forward Detection**
   - Distinguish between reply and forward message types
   - Extract original sender from bot's relayed messages
   - Conditional ping based on bot mention in parent
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def relay_discord_message(self, msg, bot_user, edited=False):
         preamble_items = []
         
         if edited:
             preamble_items.append("edited previous message")
         
         if msg.reference:
             if msg.reference.type == MessageReferenceType.reply:
                 sender = self.extract_sender_from_discord_message(
                     msg.reference.resolved, bot_user, msg
                 )
                 preamble_items.append(f"in reply to {sender}")
             elif msg.reference.type == MessageReferenceType.forward:
                 sender = self.extract_sender_from_discord_message(
                     msg.reference.resolved, bot_user
                 )
                 preamble_items.append(f"forwarded message from {sender}")
         
         preamble = "(" + ", ".join(preamble_items) + ") " if preamble_items else ""
         irc_message = f"{bold(name)}: {preamble}{text}"
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better context for replies
   - **Effort:** 1-2 hours
   - **Status:** Partial - we handle replies, not forwards

4. **✅ IRC Formatting to Discord Markdown**
   - Parse IRC color/formatting codes
   - Convert to Discord markdown equivalents
   - Escape special characters to prevent parsing
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def format_irc_message(self, msg):
         chunklist = Tags.parse(msg)  # Parse IRC formatting
         
         ret = ""
         for chunk in chunklist.children:
             text = chunk.text
             text = text.replace("\\", "\\\\")  # Escape backslashes
             text = text.replace("<", "\\<")    # Prevent Discord parsing
             
             if "bold" in chunk.tags:
                 text = f"**{text}**"
             if "monospace" in chunk.tags:
                 text = f"`{text}`"
             if "italics" in chunk.tags:
                 text = f"*{text}*"
             if "strikethrough" in chunk.tags:
                 text = f"~~{text}~~"
             if "underline" in chunk.tags:
                 text = f"__{text}__"
             
             ret += text
         
         return ret
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better formatting preservation
   - **Effort:** 2-3 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented

5. **✅ Username Mention Conversion**
   - Find `[username]` patterns in IRC messages
   - Look up Discord guild members by name
   - Convert to Discord mention format `<@user_id>`
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def relay_irc_message(self, who, what, action):
         text = f"**<{who}>** {self.format_irc_message(what)}"
         channel = self.get_channel(self.cfg.channel)
         
         def replacement_callback(match):
             username = match.group(1)
             user = channel.guild.get_member_named(username)
             
             if not user:
                 return username
             
             return f"<@{user.id}>"
         
         # Find all [username] and convert to mentions
         text = re.sub(r"\[(.*?)\]", replacement_callback, text)
         
         await channel.send(text, suppress_embeds=True)
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better mention handling
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Status:** Not implemented

6. **✅ SASL Authentication**
   - Use SASL for IRC authentication
   - More secure than NickServ IDENTIFY
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     self.ident(
         self.cfg.nick,
         sasl_username=self.cfg.sasl_username,
         sasl_password=self.cfg.sasl_password,
     )
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better security
   - **Effort:** 1 hour (if IRC library supports)
   - **Status:** Not implemented

7. **✅ Linear Reconnect Backoff**
   - Simple linear backoff: 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s...
   - Simpler than exponential, still effective
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     self.set_reconnect(lambda n: 10 * n)  # n = retry count
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Alternative to exponential
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

8. **✅ Event Dispatcher Pattern**
   - Central event dispatcher with typed events
   - Targets register to receive specific event types
   - Graceful error handling per target
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     class Dispatcher:
         def __init__(self):
             self.targets = []
         
         def register_target(self, target):
             self.targets.append(target)
         
         def dispatch(self, source, evt):
             transmitted = {"source": source, **evt}
             for tgt in self.targets:
                 try:
                     if tgt.accept_event(transmitted):
                         tgt.push_event(transmitted)
                 except Exception:
                     logging.exception("Failed to pass event to %r", tgt)
                     continue  # Don't let one target break others
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - We already have event bus
   - **Effort:** N/A
   - **Status:** We have similar architecture

9. **✅ Embed Suppression**
   - Use `suppress_embeds=True` when sending to Discord
   - Prevents automatic URL preview embeds
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     await channel.send(text, suppress_embeds=True)
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Cleaner message display
   - **Effort:** 5 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

### Recommended Additions to ATL Bridge

**Immediate (High Priority):**

1. Zero-width space ping prevention - Simple and effective (15 min)
2. Smart IRC nick sanitization - Sophisticated algorithm (2 hours)

**Short-term (Medium Priority):**
3. Reply/forward detection - Better context (1-2 hours)
4. IRC formatting to Discord markdown - Better preservation (2-3 hours)
5. Username mention conversion - Better mentions (1 hour)
6. SASL authentication - Better security (1 hour)

**Long-term (Low Priority):**
7. Linear reconnect backoff - Alternative approach (30 min)
8. Embed suppression flag (5 min)

**Total estimated effort:** 8-11 hours for immediate + short-term features

### Key Insights from Chat-Bridge

**Strengths:**

- Zero-width space for ping prevention (simple, effective)
- Sophisticated word-boundary nick matching (from Textual)
- `[username]` passthrough for intentional pings
- IRC formatting to Discord markdown conversion
- Event dispatcher with graceful error handling
- SASL authentication support

**Weaknesses:**

- No puppet system (single bot)
- No message ID tracking
- No rate limiting
- Simple linear backoff (not exponential)
- Custom for Dolphin project (not general purpose)

**Best practices to adopt:**

- Zero-width space (`\ufeff`) for ping prevention
- Word boundary detection for nick matching
- Sort nicks by length to match longer names first
- `[nick]` syntax for intentional pings
- Parse IRC formatting codes and convert to Discord markdown
- `suppress_embeds=True` to prevent URL previews
- Graceful error handling in event dispatcher (don't let one target break others)

## Cord Implementation Patterns

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Source:** [cord](https://git.gay/copygirl/cord) - JavaScript IRC-Discord bot framework

### Implementation Patterns to Adopt

1. **✅ Message Parts Architecture**
   - Messages composed of "parts" (strings, objects, mentions, attachments)
   - Parts can be `toString()`ed or socket-specific rendering
   - Enables rich message composition and transformation
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     @dataclass
     class MessagePart:
         pass
     
     @dataclass
     class TextPart(MessagePart):
         text: str
         def __str__(self): return self.text
     
     @dataclass
     class UserPart(MessagePart):
         user: User
         def __str__(self): return self.user.name
         def to_discord(self): return f"<@{self.user.id}>"
         def to_irc(self): return self.user.nick
     
     @dataclass
     class ActionPart(MessagePart):
         pass  # Marker for /me actions
     
     class Message:
         parts: list[MessagePart]
         
         def to_string(self) -> str:
             return "".join(str(p) for p in self.parts)
         
         def to_discord(self) -> str:
             return "".join(
                 p.to_discord() if hasattr(p, 'to_discord') else str(p)
                 for p in self.parts
             )
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better abstraction
   - **Effort:** 4-5 hours to refactor
   - **Status:** We use simple strings, not parts

2. **✅ Message Augmentation Pattern**
   - Transform message parts based on patterns (regex, class, equality)
   - Chain multiple augmentations
   - Enables flexible message processing
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     class Message:
         def augment(self, test, action):
             """Transform parts matching test using action function"""
             new_parts = []
             
             for part in self.parts:
                 # Regex test
                 if isinstance(test, re.Pattern) and isinstance(part, str):
                     match = test.search(part)
                     if match:
                         # Insert text before match
                         if match.start() > 0:
                             new_parts.append(part[:match.start()])
                         # Apply action
                         result = action(*match.groups())
                         new_parts.extend(result if isinstance(result, list) else [result])
                         # Insert text after match
                         if match.end() < len(part):
                             new_parts.append(part[match.end():])
                         continue
                 
                 # Class test
                 elif isinstance(test, type) and isinstance(part, test):
                     result = action(part)
                     new_parts.extend(result if isinstance(result, list) else [result])
                     continue
                 
                 # Equality test
                 elif part == test:
                     result = action(part)
                     new_parts.extend(result if isinstance(result, list) else [result])
                     continue
                 
                 new_parts.append(part)
             
             self.parts = new_parts
             return self  # Allow chaining
         
         def augment_clone(self, test, action):
             """Return augmented copy without modifying original"""
             cloned = Message(self.parts.copy())
             return cloned.augment(test, action)
     
     # Usage example
     message.augment(r'<@(\d+)>', lambda user_id: UserMention(user_id)) \
            .augment(ActionMarker, lambda _: ["* ", message.sender, " "]) \
            .augment(r'\n', lambda: NewLine())
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Interesting pattern but complex
   - **Effort:** 6-8 hours
   - **Status:** Not needed for our use case

3. **✅ Silent Message Sending**
   - `send()` triggers message events, `sendSilent()` doesn't
   - Prevents infinite loops in bridge relaying
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     class Channel:
         async def send(self, *parts, silent=False):
             message = Message(parts=parts, sender=self.bot.user, target=self)
             
             if not silent:
                 # Emit message event for other plugs/bridges
                 self.emit("message", message)
             
             # Actually send to platform
             await self._platform_send(message)
         
         async def send_silent(self, *parts):
             await self.send(*parts, silent=True)
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Prevents bridge loops
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Status:** We check webhook_id/author, not silent flag

4. **✅ Pluggable Architecture**
   - Modular "plugs" (plugins) system
   - Common interface works across all sockets
   - Bridge plug relays between any linked channels
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     class Plug:
         def __init__(self, cord, config):
             self.cord = cord
             self.config = config
         
         def activate(self):
             """Register event handlers"""
             pass
     
     class BridgePlug(Plug):
         def activate(self):
             self.cord.on("message", self.relay_message)
         
         def relay_message(self, message):
             bridge = self.get_bridge_for_channel(message.target)
             if not bridge:
                 return
             
             # Relay to all other channels in bridge
             for channel in bridge.channels:
                 if channel != message.target:
                     channel.send_silent(*message.parts)
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - We have adapter pattern
   - **Effort:** N/A
   - **Status:** Similar architecture already

5. **✅ IRC Flood Protection**
   - Built-in flood protection in IRC library
   - Enabled by default with `floodProtection: true`
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     # Using irc library with flood protection
     irc_options = {
         'autoConnect': False,
         'floodProtection': True,  # Built-in rate limiting
         'stripColors': True
     }
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Already in TODO from other audits
   - **Effort:** N/A
   - **Status:** Should implement token bucket

6. **✅ Strip IRC Colors**
   - Automatically strip IRC color codes
   - Cleaner messages for Discord
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     irc_options = {
         'stripColors': True  # Remove IRC color codes
     }
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Simple feature
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

7. **✅ Resolve Strings Pattern**
   - Each resolveable (user/channel) has multiple resolve strings
   - Format: `socket_id:identifier`
   - Enables cross-platform resolution
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     class Resolveable:
         @property
         def resolve_strings(self) -> list[str]:
             """Return all strings that could resolve to this object"""
             return [
                 f"{self.socket.id}:{self.name}",
                 f"{self.socket.id}:{self.id}",
             ]
     
     class Bridge:
         def __init__(self):
             self._resolve_map = {}  # resolve_string -> bridge
         
         def register_channel(self, channel):
             for resolve in channel.resolve_strings:
                 self._resolve_map[resolve] = self.get_bridge(channel)
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Interesting pattern
   - **Effort:** 3-4 hours
   - **Status:** We use direct ID mapping

### Recommended Additions to ATL Bridge

**Immediate (High Priority):**

1. Silent message sending - Prevent bridge loops (1 hour)

**Short-term (Medium Priority):**
2. Message parts architecture - Better abstraction (4-5 hours)

**Long-term (Low Priority):**
3. Strip IRC colors option (30 min)
4. Message augmentation pattern (6-8 hours)
5. Resolve strings pattern (3-4 hours)

**Total estimated effort:** 15-18 hours for all features

### Key Insights from Cord

**Strengths:**

- Message parts architecture enables rich composition
- Augmentation pattern for flexible message transformation
- Silent sending prevents bridge loops
- Pluggable architecture with common interface
- Built-in IRC flood protection
- Resolve strings for cross-platform resolution

**Weaknesses:**

- JavaScript (not Python)
- Complex abstraction (parts + augmentation)
- No message ID tracking
- No retry logic
- Personal bot, not production-focused

**Best practices to adopt:**

- Silent message sending to prevent event loops
- Message parts for platform-agnostic composition
- Augmentation pattern for flexible transformations
- Built-in flood protection in IRC library
- Strip IRC colors for cleaner Discord messages
- Resolve strings for flexible object resolution

**Note:** Cord's architecture is interesting but quite different from our event-driven approach. The message parts and augmentation patterns are elegant but may be over-engineering for our use case. The most valuable takeaway is the silent sending pattern to prevent bridge loops.

## DevSE-Chan Implementation Patterns

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Source:** [devse-chan](https://github.com/d0p1s4m4/devse-chan) - Python IRC-Discord bridge for DevSE

### Implementation Patterns to Adopt

1. **✅ Hash-Based Avatar Generation**
   - Generate deterministic color from nickname hash
   - Use UI Avatars API for avatar generation
   - Fallback when Discord user not found
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def nick_to_hexcolor(nick: str) -> str:
         hash_val = 0
         for c in nick:
             hash_val = ord(c) + ((hash_val << 5) - hash_val)
         
         color = ''
         for i in range(3):
             val = (hash_val >> (i * 8)) & 0xFF
             color += ('00' + hex(val)[2:])[-2:]
         return color
     
     def gen_avatar_from_nick(nick: str) -> str:
         return f"https://eu.ui-avatars.com/api/?background={nick_to_hexcolor(nick)}&name={nick}"
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better than robohash
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** We use Portal for avatars

2. **✅ Message Edit/Delete Logging**
   - Log edits and deletes to separate channel
   - Include before/after content for edits
   - Markdown formatting for readability
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     @bot.event
     async def on_message_edit(before, after):
         if before.webhook_id:
             return
         
         data = [
             "```markdown",
             "# Message Edited",
             f"[{before.created_at}](#{before.channel})",
             f"< {before.author} >",
             "<Before  >",
             f"<Message > {before.clean_content}",
             "",
             "<After   >",
             f"<Message > {after.clean_content}",
             "```"
         ]
         
         await log_channel.send("\n".join(data))
     
     @bot.event
     async def on_message_delete(message):
         data = [
             "```markdown",
             "# Message Deleted",
             f"[{message.created_at}](#{message.channel})",
             f"< {message.author} >",
             f"<Message > {message.clean_content}",
             "```"
         ]
         
         await log_channel.send("\n".join(data))
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Audit feature, not core bridging
   - **Effort:** 1-2 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented

3. **✅ Welcome/Goodbye Messages**
   - Template-based messages with substitution
   - Triggered on member join/remove
   - Includes timestamp and date
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     from string import Template
     from datetime import datetime
     
     @bot.event
     async def on_member_join(member):
         msg = Template(config['messages']['welcome'])
         now = datetime.utcnow()
         m = msg.substitute(
             name=member.display_name,
             time=now.strftime("%H:%M:%S UTC"),
             date=now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
         )
         await welcome_channel.send(m)
     
     @bot.event
     async def on_member_remove(member):
         msg = Template(config['messages']['goodbye'])
         now = datetime.utcnow()
         m = msg.substitute(
             name=member.display_name,
             time=now.strftime("%H:%M:%S UTC"),
             date=now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
         )
         await welcome_channel.send(m)
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Nice-to-have feature
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Status:** Not implemented

4. **✅ CTCP VERSION/SOURCE Response**
   - Respond to CTCP VERSION with system info
   - Respond to CTCP SOURCE with repository URL
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     @irc.on('privmsg')
     async def irc_message(nick, target, message, **kwargs):
         if target == config['nick']:
             if message == '\001VERSION\001':
                 system = 'GNU/Linux' if platform.system() == 'Linux' else platform.system()
                 irc.send('NOTICE', target=nick, 
                         message=f"\001VERSION devse-chan on {system}\001")
             elif message == '\001SOURCE\001':
                 irc.send('NOTICE', target=nick,
                         message='\001SOURCE https://github.com/d0p1s4m4/devse-chan\001')
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - IRC etiquette
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

5. **✅ Fixed Delay Between Messages**
   - Sleep 1s before sending, 2s after sending
   - Simple flood control (not sophisticated)
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def to_irc(self, author, msg_list):
         for msg in msg_list:
             if len(msg) > 0:
                 time.sleep(1)  # Wait before send
                 self.irc.send(author, msg)
                 time.sleep(2)  # Wait after send
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Too simplistic
   - **Effort:** N/A
   - **Status:** Should use token bucket instead

6. **✅ IRC Color Code in Messages**
   - Use `\x03` color codes for nicknames
   - Color 6 (magenta) for bridged nicknames
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def send(self, nick, message):
         # \x036 = magenta color, \x0F = reset
         self.irc.send('PRIVMSG', target=channel, 
                      message=f"<\x036{nick}\x0F> {message}")
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Cosmetic feature
   - **Effort:** 15 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

7. **✅ Confuse Configuration Library**
   - YAML-based configuration with validation
   - Hierarchical config access
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     import confuse
     
     config = confuse.Configuration('devsechan')
     # Access: config['discord']['token'].get()
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - We use pydantic
   - **Effort:** N/A
   - **Status:** We have better config system

### Recommended Additions to ATL Bridge

**Immediate (High Priority):**

- None (no critical patterns)

**Short-term (Medium Priority):**

1. Hash-based avatar generation - Better fallback (30 min)

**Long-term (Low Priority):**
2. Message edit/delete logging - Audit feature (1-2 hours)
3. Welcome/goodbye messages - Community feature (1 hour)
4. CTCP VERSION/SOURCE - IRC etiquette (30 min)
5. IRC color codes for nicknames - Cosmetic (15 min)

**Total estimated effort:** 3-4 hours for all features

### Key Insights from DevSE-Chan

**Strengths:**

- Simple, focused implementation (~200 LOC)
- Hash-based avatar generation (deterministic colors)
- Message edit/delete logging for moderation
- Template-based welcome/goodbye messages
- CTCP VERSION/SOURCE responses

**Weaknesses:**

- Fixed delays instead of proper rate limiting (1s + 2s)
- No message ID tracking
- No retry logic
- No error recovery
- Very basic implementation

**Best practices to adopt:**

- Hash-based avatar color generation (deterministic)
- UI Avatars API for fallback avatars
- Message edit/delete logging to separate channel
- Template-based messages with datetime substitution
- CTCP VERSION/SOURCE responses for IRC etiquette

**Note:** DevSE-Chan is a very simple bridge (~200 lines) with basic features. The most useful pattern is the hash-based avatar generation which provides consistent, deterministic colors for IRC users. The fixed delay approach (sleep 1s + 2s) is too simplistic and should be replaced with proper token bucket rate limiting. Most other features are nice-to-have but not critical for core bridging functionality.

   - Optional uvloop for faster asyncio event loop
   - aiomultiprocess for parallel message sending
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     # Import ujson if available for 2-3x faster JSON
     try:
         import ujson as json
     except ImportError:
         import json
     
     # Import uvloop if available for faster event loop
     try:
         import uvloop
         uvloop.install()
     except ImportError:
         pass
     
     # Use aiomultiprocess for parallel operations
     import aiomultiprocess
     from aiomultiprocess import Worker
     
     if not sys.platform == 'win32':
         aiomultiprocess.set_start_method("fork")
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Performance boost
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

2. **✅ Webhook Cache Store**
   - In-memory webhook cache per server

         def __init__(self, bot):
             self.bot = bot
             self.webhooks = {}  # {server_id: {identifier: webhook}}
         
         def store_webhook(self, webhook, identifier, server):
             self.webhooks.setdefault(server, {})[identifier] = webhook
             return len(self.webhooks[server])
         
         def get_webhook(self, identifier):
             for guild in self.webhooks.keys():
                 if identifier in self.webhooks[guild]:
                     return self.webhooks[guild][identifier]
             raise ValueError('invalid webhook')
         
         def get_webhooks(self, server):
             if not self.webhooks[server]:
                 raise ValueError('no webhooks')
             return list(self.webhooks[server].values())
         
         def clear(self, server=None):
             if server:
                 self.webhooks[server] = {}
             else:
                 self.webhooks = {}
     ```

     async def backup_message_cache(self):
         self.logger.info("Backing up message cache...")
         cache_data = {
             'messages': self.message_cache,
             'timestamp': time.time()
         }
         compress_json.dump(cache_data, 'message_cache.json.gz')
     
     async def load_message_cache(self):
         try:
             cache_data = compress_json.load('message_cache.json.gz')
             self.message_cache = cache_data['messages']
             self.logger.info(f"Loaded {len(self.message_cache)} cached messages")
         except FileNotFoundError:
             self.message_cache = {}
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Better reliability
   - **Effort:** 2 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented

         '\U00002B1C',  # White square
         '\U00002B1B'   # Black square
     ]
     
     def get_dedupe_emoji(message_id):
         # Use message ID to deterministically pick emoji
         return dedupe_emojis[hash(message_id) % len(dedupe_emojis)]
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Visual feature
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

5. **✅ AllowedMentions Configuration**
   - Disable @everyone and role mentions by default
   - Emergency mentions for alerts
   - Implementation:

     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Security/anti-abuse
   - **Effort:** 15 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

6. **✅ Plugin System**
   - External platform support via plugins
   - Revolt and Guilded support plugins
   - Extensible architecture
   - Implementation:

     class PlatformPlugin:
         def __init__(self, bot):
             self.bot = bot
         
         async def send_message(self, channel_id, content):
             raise NotImplementedError
         
         async def on_message(self, message):
             raise NotImplementedError
     
     # Load plugins
     plugins = {}
     for plugin_file in os.listdir('plugins'):
         if plugin_file.endswith('.py'):
             module = importlib.import_module(f'plugins.{plugin_file[:-3]}')
             plugins[module.PLATFORM_NAME] = module.Plugin(bot)
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - We focus on IRC/XMPP/Discord
   - **Effort:** N/A
   - **Status:** Not needed for our scope

7. **✅ Built-in Upgrader**
   - Automatic config migration
   - Version management
   - Easy updates

     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Nice-to-have
   - **Effort:** 4-5 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented

8. **✅ Compressed JSON Storage**
   - Use compress_json for data storage
   - Reduces disk usage
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     import compress_json
     
     # Save
     compress_json.dump(data, 'data.json.gz')
     
     # Load
     data = compress_json.load('data.json.gz')
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Optimization
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

### Recommended Additions to ATL Bridge

**Immediate (High Priority):**

1. Webhook cache store - Reduce API calls (1 hour)
2. Message cache backup - Persist between restarts (2 hours)
3. AllowedMentions configuration - Security (15 min)

**Short-term (Medium Priority):**
4. Performance optimizations - ujson + uvloop (30 min)

**Long-term (Low Priority):**
5. Deduplication emojis - Visual indicators (30 min)
6. Compressed JSON storage - Disk optimization (30 min)
7. Built-in upgrader - Easy updates (4-5 hours)

**Total estimated effort:** 8-10 hours for immediate + short-term features

### Key Insights from Unifier

**Strengths:**

- Production-focused with 33 msg/s throughput claim
- Performance optimizations (ujson, uvloop, aiomultiprocess)
- Webhook caching reduces API calls
- Message cache backup for persistence
- AllowedMentions for security
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Built-in upgrader for easy maintenance
- Compressed JSON for storage efficiency

**Weaknesses:**

- Large codebase (complex)
- Discord-focused (limited IRC/XMPP)
- AGPLv3 license (copyleft)

**Best practices to adopt:**

- Optional performance libraries (ujson, uvloop)
- Structured webhook cache with per-server storage
- Message cache backup on graceful shutdown
- AllowedMentions to prevent mention abuse
- Compressed JSON for efficient storage
- Deduplication emojis for visual feedback

**Note:** Unifier is a large, production-focused Discord bridge with impressive performance claims (33 msg/s). The most valuable patterns are the webhook cache store, message cache backup, and performance optimizations. The plugin system is interesting but out of scope for our IRC/XMPP/Discord focus. The AllowedMentions configuration is a simple but important security feature we should adopt.

### 9. **✅ Link Buttons for Replies**

- Use Discord link buttons to show reply context
- Jump to original message with URL button
- Compact and comfortable display modes
- Implementation:

     ```python
     import nextcord
     
     # Compact mode - single button with reply arrow emoji
     components = nextcord.ui.View()
     components.add_item(
         nextcord.ui.Button(
             style=nextcord.ButtonStyle.url,
             label="↩️ Reply to @username",
             emoji='↩️',
             url=message_url,
             disabled=message_url is None
         )
     )
     
     # Comfortable mode - two buttons (heading + content preview)
     components.add_item(
         nextcord.ui.Button(
             style=nextcord.ButtonStyle.url,
             label="Replying to @username",
             url=message_url
         )
     )
     
     # Second button with content preview
     components.add_item(
         nextcord.ui.Button(
             style=nextcord.ButtonStyle.blurple,  # Color by platform
             label="Message content preview...",
             emoji='🏞️' if has_attachments else None,
             url=message_url
         )
     )
     
     await channel.send(content, view=components)
     ```

- **Priority:** Medium - Better UX for replies
- **Effort:** 2-3 hours
- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Benefits:**
  - Visual reply context without quoting full message
  - Jump to original message with one click
  - Cleaner than text-based reply indicators
  - Platform-specific button colors (Discord=blue, Revolt=red, etc.)
  - Attachment indicator emoji

**Updated total estimated effort:** 10-13 hours for immediate + short-term features

## DIBridge (OpenTTD) Implementation Patterns

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Source:** [dibridge](https://github.com/OpenTTD/dibridge) - Python Discord-IRC bridge by OpenTTD

### Implementation Patterns to Adopt

1. **✅ IPv6 CIDR Range for IRC Puppets**
   - Assign unique IPv6 address to each Discord user's IRC puppet
   - Bypasses IRC network connection limits (typically 3 per IP)
   - Deterministic IP assignment (same user = same IP)
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     import ipaddress
     import hashlib
     
     class IRCPuppetManager:

             self.puppet_ip_range = ipaddress.ip_network(puppet_ip_range)
             
             if self.puppet_ip_range.num_addresses < 2**32:

                 16
             )
             offset = hash_val % self.puppet_ip_range.num_addresses

                     family=socket.AF_INET6,
                     local_addr=local_addr,
                     ssl=use_ssl
                 )
             )
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Advanced feature, requires infrastructure
   - **Effort:** 4-5 hours + infrastructure setup
   - **Status:** Not implemented
   - **Requirements:**
     - Linux 4.3+ kernel
     - IPv6 prefix delegation (at least /96, preferably /80)
     - Kernel config: `sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip_nonlocal_bind=1`
     - Route setup: `ip route add local 2001:db8::/80 dev eth0`
   - **Benefits:**
     - Native IRC feel (each Discord user = separate IRC connection)
     - Tab completion works (`us<tab>` → `username`)
     - IRC bans work per-user (same user always gets same IP)
     - Bypasses connection limits on IRC networks
     - No `<username> message` prefix needed

2. **✅ Nickname Collision Handling**
   - Try `[d]` suffix first (Discord indicator)
   - Fall back to `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.
   - Automatic nick reclaim after netsplit
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def on_nicknameinuse(self, client, event):
         # First try: add [d] for Discord
         if self.nickname_iteration == 0:
             self.nickname = f"{self.nickname_original}[d]"
             self.nickname_iteration += 1
             client.nick(self.nickname)
             return
         
         # Subsequent tries: add [1], [2], etc.
         self.nickname = f"{self.nickname_original}[{self.nickname_iteration}]"
         self.nickname_iteration += 1
         client.nick(self.nickname)
     
     def on_nick(self, client, event):
         if event.source.nick == self.nickname:
             # Server changed our nick (netsplit, GHOST, etc.)
             self.log.info("Nick changed to '%s' by server; reclaiming", event.target)
             asyncio.create_task(self.reclaim_nick())
     
     async def reclaim_nick(self):
         # Wait 1 second to avoid racing with legitimate users
         await asyncio.sleep(1)
         self.nickname = self.nickname_original
         self.nickname_iteration = 0
         self.client.nick(self.nickname)
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better nick handling
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Status:** Partial - we handle collisions but not reclaim

3. **✅ Puppet Idle Timeout**
   - Disconnect puppets after inactivity (default: 2 days)
   - Configurable timeout per puppet
   - Automatic cleanup
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     async def start_idle_timeout(self):
         await self.stop_idle_timeout()
         self.idle_task = asyncio.create_task(self._idle_timeout_task())
     
     async def stop_idle_timeout(self):
         if self.idle_task:
             self.idle_task.cancel()
             self.idle_task = None
     
     async def _idle_timeout_task(self):
         await asyncio.sleep(self.idle_timeout)  # e.g., 2 days
         
         self.reconnect = False
         self.client.disconnect("User went offline on Discord a while ago")
         await self.remove_puppet_func()
     
     # Reset timeout on activity
     async def on_message_sent(self):
         await self.start_idle_timeout()  # Reset timer
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Already in TODO
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Status:** We have 24h timeout, should make configurable

4. **✅ Random IPv6 Host Selection**
   - IRC servers often have multiple IPv6 addresses
   - Pick random one to distribute load
   - Avoid RFC getaddrinfo() sorting bias
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     import random
     import socket
     
     async def connect_to_irc(self, irc_host: str):
         # Get all IPv6 addresses for host
         ipv6s = await self.loop.getaddrinfo(
             irc_host,
             None,
             family=socket.AF_INET6,
             type=socket.SOCK_STREAM,
             proto=socket.IPPROTO_TCP
         )
         
         if not ipv6s:
             raise ConnectionError("No IPv6 addresses found")
         
         # Pick random one to distribute load
         irc_host_ipv6 = random.choice(ipv6s)[4][0]
         
         self.log.info("Connecting to %s (%s)", irc_host, irc_host_ipv6)
         await self.connection.connect(irc_host_ipv6, port, nick)
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Optimization
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

5. **✅ Puppet Pinger Task**
   - Send PING every 120 seconds to keep connection alive
   - Prevent idle disconnects
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     async def _pinger(self):
         while True:
             await asyncio.sleep(120)
             self.client.ping("keep-alive")
     
     def on_welcome(self, client, event):
         if self.pinger_task:
             self.pinger_task.cancel()
         self.pinger_task = asyncio.create_task(self._pinger())
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Keep-alive
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

### Recommended Additions to ATL Bridge

**Immediate (High Priority):**

- None (IPv6 puppets require infrastructure)

**Short-term (Medium Priority):**

1. Nickname collision handling with reclaim (1 hour)
2. Puppet pinger task - Keep-alive (30 min)

**Long-term (Low Priority):**
3. IPv6 CIDR range for puppets - Advanced feature (4-5 hours + infra)
4. Random IPv6 host selection - Load distribution (30 min)

**Total estimated effort:** 2-6.5 hours (excluding IPv6 infrastructure)

### Key Insights from DIBridge

**Strengths:**

- IPv6 CIDR range for puppets is innovative and elegant
- Solves IRC connection limit problem
- Native IRC feel (no `<username>` prefix)
- Deterministic IP assignment (same user = same IP)
- Nickname collision handling with reclaim
- Puppet idle timeout for cleanup

**Weaknesses:**

- Requires IPv6 infrastructure and kernel config
- Linux 4.3+ only for IPv6 binding
- Single channel bridge only
- No edit/reaction support

**Best practices to adopt:**

- IPv6 puppet addressing (if infrastructure available)
- Nickname collision handling with `[d]` suffix
- Automatic nick reclaim after netsplit
- Puppet idle timeout (configurable)
- Pinger task for keep-alive
- Random IPv6 host selection for load distribution

**Note:** DIBridge's IPv6 CIDR range for puppets is a brilliant solution to IRC connection limits, but requires significant infrastructure setup (IPv6 prefix delegation, kernel config, routing). The nickname collision handling and puppet idle timeout are more immediately applicable patterns. The approach gives a truly native IRC feel where each Discord user appears as a separate IRC user with their own connection and IP address.

## Dis4IRC Implementation Patterns

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Source:** [Dis4IRC](https://github.com/zachbr/Dis4IRC) - Kotlin Discord-IRC bridge

### Implementation Patterns to Adopt

1. **✅ Mutator Pattern for Message Processing**
   - Plugin-like system for message transformations
   - Each mutator can modify message or halt processing
   - Lifecycle control (CONTINUE, STOP, DISCARD)
   - Track applied mutators to prevent double-application
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     from enum import Enum
     from typing import Protocol
     
     class LifeCycle(Enum):
         CONTINUE = "continue"  # Continue to next mutator
         STOP = "stop"          # Stop processing, send message
         DISCARD = "discard"    # Discard message entirely
     
     class Mutator(Protocol):
         def mutate(self, message: Message) -> LifeCycle:
             ...
     
     class MutatorManager:
         def __init__(self):
             self.mutators: list[Mutator] = []
         
         def register_mutator(self, mutator: Mutator):
             self.mutators.append(mutator)
         
         def apply_mutators(self, message: Message) -> Message | None:
             for mutator in self.mutators:
                 # Skip if already applied
                 if mutator.__class__ in message.applied_mutators:
                     continue
                 
                 lifecycle = mutator.mutate(message)
                 message.applied_mutators.add(mutator.__class__)
                 
                 if lifecycle == LifeCycle.DISCARD:
                     return None
                 elif lifecycle == LifeCycle.STOP:
                     break
             
             return message
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Clean architecture
   - **Effort:** 3-4 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented

2. **✅ Automatic Paste Service for Long Messages**
   - Upload long messages to paste service
   - Replace with short summary + paste URL
   - Configurable thresholds (length, newlines, code blocks)
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     class PasteLongMessages(Mutator):
         def __init__(self, config):
             self.max_newlines = config.get('max_new_lines', 4)
             self.max_length = config.get('max_message_length', 450)
             self.paste_expiry_days = config.get('paste_expiration_in_days', 7)
         
         def mutate(self, message: Message) -> LifeCycle:
             # Only paste Discord messages going to IRC
             if message.source != 'discord':
                 return LifeCycle.CONTINUE
             
             should_paste = False
             
             # Check newline count
             if message.content.count('\n') > self.max_newlines:
                 should_paste = True
             
             # Check for code blocks
             if message.content.count('```') >= 2:
                 should_paste = True
             
             # Check length
             if len(message.content) > self.max_length:
                 should_paste = True
             
             if not should_paste:
                 return LifeCycle.CONTINUE
             
             # Upload to paste service
             paste_url = await self.upload_paste(message.content)
             
             # Replace message with summary
             preview = message.content[:100] + "..." if len(message.content) > 100 else message.content
             message.content = f"{preview}\nFull message: {paste_url}"
             
             return LifeCycle.CONTINUE
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Better UX for long messages
   - **Effort:** 2-3 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented

3. **✅ Strategic Zero-Width Space Insertion**
   - Insert `\u200B` (zero-width space) in nicknames
   - Prevents accidental pings
   - Place after vowels for natural breaking
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     ANTI_PING_CHAR = '\u200B'  # Zero-width space
     
     def rebuild_with_anti_ping(nick: str) -> str:
         """Insert zero-width space after vowels to prevent pings"""
         vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
         result = []
         
         for i, char in enumerate(nick):
             result.append(char)
             # Insert after vowels (but not at end)
             if char in vowels and i < len(nick) - 1:
                 result.append(ANTI_PING_CHAR)
         
         return ''.join(result)
     
     # Usage
     safe_nick = rebuild_with_anti_ping("username")  # "us\u200Bern\u200Bame"
     ```

   - **Priority:** High - Already in TODO from other audits
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

4. **✅ Strip Anti-Ping Characters Mutator**
   - Remove zero-width spaces from IRC → Discord
   - Clean up for Discord display
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     class StripAntiPingCharacters(Mutator):
         def mutate(self, message: Message) -> LifeCycle:
             if message.source == 'irc':
                 message.content = message.content.replace('\u200B', '')
             return LifeCycle.CONTINUE
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Cleanup
   - **Effort:** 15 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

5. **✅ No-Prefix Regex for Bot Commands**
   - Allow IRC bot commands without username prefix
   - Configurable regex pattern
   - Example: `^\\.[A-Za-z0-9]` matches `.help`, `.info`
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     import re
     
     class BotCommandHandler:
         def __init__(self, no_prefix_pattern: str):
             self.no_prefix_regex = re.compile(no_prefix_pattern)
         
         def should_add_prefix(self, message: str) -> bool:
             """Check if message should have sender prefix"""
             return not self.no_prefix_regex.match(message)
         
         def format_message(self, sender: str, content: str) -> str:
             if self.should_add_prefix(content):
                 return f"<{sender}> {content}"
             else:
                 return content  # Send as-is for bot commands
     
     # Config: no-prefix-regex: "^\\.[A-Za-z0-9]"
     # ".help" → ".help" (no prefix)
     # "hello" → "<username> hello" (with prefix)
     ```

   - **Priority:** Medium - Better bot integration
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Status:** Not implemented

6. **✅ Nickname Color Support**
   - Use IRC color codes for nicknames
   - Configurable enable/disable
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     def create_sender_prefix(sender: str, use_color: bool, anti_ping: bool) -> str:
         name = sender
         
         if anti_ping:
             name = rebuild_with_anti_ping(name)
         
         if use_color:
             # Hash username to get consistent color
             color_code = hash(sender) % 16
             name = f"\x03{color_code:02d}{name}\x03"
         
         return f"<{name}>"
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Cosmetic
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

7. **✅ Statistics Manager**
   - Track messages bridged per direction
   - Uptime tracking
   - Expose via command
   - Implementation:

     ```python
     class StatisticsManager:
         def __init__(self):
             self.start_time = time.time()
             self.messages_discord_to_irc = 0
             self.messages_irc_to_discord = 0
         
         def record_message(self, source: str):
             if source == 'discord':
                 self.messages_discord_to_irc += 1
             else:
                 self.messages_irc_to_discord += 1
         
         def get_stats(self) -> dict:
             uptime = time.time() - self.start_time
             return {
                 'uptime_seconds': uptime,
                 'discord_to_irc': self.messages_discord_to_irc,
                 'irc_to_discord': self.messages_irc_to_discord,
                 'total': self.messages_discord_to_irc + self.messages_irc_to_discord
             }
     ```

   - **Priority:** Low - Monitoring
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Status:** Not implemented

### Recommended Additions to ATL Bridge

**Immediate (High Priority):**

1. Automatic paste service for long messages (2-3 hours)
2. Strategic zero-width space insertion (30 min)

**Short-term (Medium Priority):**
3. Mutator pattern for message processing (3-4 hours)
4. Strip anti-ping characters (15 min)
5. No-prefix regex for bot commands (1 hour)

**Long-term (Low Priority):**
6. Nickname color support (30 min)
7. Statistics manager (1 hour)

**Total estimated effort:** 8-10 hours for immediate + short-term features

### Key Insights from Dis4IRC

**Strengths:**

- Mutator pattern provides clean, extensible architecture
- Automatic paste service for long messages (smart thresholds)
- Strategic zero-width space placement (after vowels)
- No-prefix regex for bot command passthrough
- Lifecycle control for message processing
- Statistics tracking

**Weaknesses:**

- Kotlin (not Python, harder to adapt)
- No multi-presence/puppets
- Single channel bridge

**Best practices to adopt:**

- Mutator pattern for extensible message processing
- Automatic paste service with configurable thresholds
- Zero-width space after vowels (more natural than after first char)
- Strip anti-ping chars when going back to Discord
- No-prefix regex for bot commands
- Track applied mutators to prevent double-application
- Lifecycle control (CONTINUE, STOP, DISCARD)

**Note:** Dis4IRC's mutator pattern is elegant and provides a clean way to add message transformations. The automatic paste service is particularly useful for handling long messages and code blocks. The strategic placement of zero-width spaces after vowels is more sophisticated than simple insertion after the first character. The no-prefix regex allows IRC bot commands to work naturally without username prefixes.

## discord-irc (Reactiflux) Implementation Patterns

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Source:** [discord-irc](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc) - JavaScript Discord-IRC bridge by Reactiflux

### Implementation Patterns to Adopt

1. **✅ IRC Formatting Library**
   - Use `irc-formatting` library for bidirectional conversion
   - Discord markdown ↔ IRC control codes
   - Already handles: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
   - **Priority:** Medium - Already in TODO from other audits
   - **Effort:** 2-3 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented

2. **✅ Auto-Send Commands on Connect**
   - Execute IRC commands automatically after connection
   - Useful for NickServ IDENTIFY, MODE changes, etc.
   - Config: `autoSendCommands: [["PRIVMSG", "NickServ", "IDENTIFY password"]]`
   - **Priority:** Medium - Convenience feature
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Status:** Not implemented

3. **✅ Custom Format Strings**
   - Template-based message formatting
   - Patterns: `{$nickname}`, `{$text}`, `{$attachmentURL}`
   - Config: `format: { ircText: "<{$displayUsername}> {$text}" }`
   - **Priority:** Low - Customization
   - **Effort:** 1-2 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented

4. **✅ Webhook Avatar URL Template**
   - Custom avatar URL for unknown IRC users
   - Default: `https://robohash.org/{$nickname}`
   - Config: `format: { webhookAvatarURL: "https://robohash.org/{$nickname}" }`
   - **Priority:** Low - Already in TODO (robohash)
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

**Total estimated effort:** 4.5-6.5 hours

### Key Insights from discord-irc

**Strengths:**

- Popular, well-maintained (Reactiflux)
- IRC formatting library for bidirectional conversion
- Auto-send commands on connect
- Custom format strings for flexibility
- Webhook support with avatar templates

**Weaknesses:**

- No puppets (single bot)
- JavaScript (not Python)
- Basic feature set

**Best practices to adopt:**

- Use dedicated IRC formatting library
- Auto-send commands for NickServ/MODE
- Template-based message formatting
- Robohash for avatar generation

**Note:** discord-irc is a mature, popular bridge used by Reactiflux. Most of its patterns have been covered by other audits. The main takeaway is using a dedicated IRC formatting library for bidirectional markdown ↔ IRC control code conversion, and the auto-send commands feature for post-connection setup.

**Language**: Python 3.5+  
**Architecture**: Threading-based with shared lock  
**Assessment**: Basic implementation with minimal features

### Patterns Identified

1. **✅ Markdown Escaping for IRC Nicks**
   - IRC → Discord: Escapes markdown special chars in nicknames
   - Prevents IRC nicks from breaking Discord formatting
   - Pattern: `re.sub(r"(]|-|\\|[`*_{}[()#+.!])", r'\\\1', nick)`
   - Escapes: `] - \ [` * _ { } [ ( ) # + . !`
   - **Priority:** Medium - Prevents formatting issues
   - **Effort:** 1-2 hours
   - **Status:** Not implemented

2. **Threading Architecture** (Not Applicable)
   - Separate threads for IRC and Discord clients
   - Shared `threading.Lock()` for console output synchronization
   - Daemon thread for IRC (dies when main thread exits)
   - **Assessment:** Our async architecture is superior; no action needed

3. **Attachment Handling** (Already Better)
   - Appends first attachment URL to message content
   - Pattern: `content += ' ' + message.attachments[0].url`
   - Only handles first attachment, ignores rest
   - **Assessment:** We already handle attachments better; no action needed

4. **Bot Owner Commands** (Low Priority)
   - `!quit` command restricted to bot owner
   - Checks `message.author.name == settings["botowner"]`
   - **Priority:** Low - Admin commands consideration
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Status:** Not implemented

5. **Clean Content Usage** (Already Implemented)
   - Uses `message.clean_content` for Discord messages
   - Converts mentions to readable format automatically
   - **Assessment:** ✅ We already use this pattern

6. **Nickname Collision Handling** (Low Priority)
   - Appends `_` to nickname on collision
   - Pattern: `connection.nick(connection.get_nickname() + "_")`
   - **Assessment:** Basic approach; we may need better collision handling for puppets
   - **Priority:** Low - Already covered in other audits
   - **Effort:** 30 minutes
   - **Status:** Not implemented

### Patterns NOT Worth Implementing

- Threading model (we use async)
- Global variables (poor design)
- Latin-1 encoding (we use UTF-8)
- Synchronous message sending (we use async)
- Single attachment handling (we handle multiple)
- Recursive reconnection (we have better retry logic)

### Key Insights from Discord-IRC-Python

**Strengths:**

- Simple, minimal implementation
- Markdown escaping for IRC nicks
- Clean content usage

**Weaknesses:**

- Threading instead of async
- Global variables
- No puppets (single bot)
- Basic feature set
- Poor error handling
- No flood control
- Latin-1 encoding

**Best practices to adopt:**

- Markdown escaping for IRC nicks in Discord messages

**Total estimated effort:** 1-2 hours (markdown escaping only)

**Priority Assessment:**

- **Immediate:** None
- **Short-term:** Markdown escaping for IRC nicks (1-2 hours)
- **Long-term:** Bot owner commands consideration

- Mock state can diverge from real Discord behavior

**Best practices to adopt:**

- Factory pattern for creating test objects (high priority)
- Async event runner to prevent race conditions (high priority)
- Message queue with peek functionality (high priority)
- Fluent assertion API for readability (medium priority)
- Mock HTTP client for isolated tests (high priority)
- Error queue for testing error handling (medium priority)

**Total estimated effort:** 34-50 hours

**Priority Assessment:**

- **Immediate:** Factory pattern (4-6 hours), Async event runner (2-3 hours), Message queue refinement (2-3 hours)
- **Short-term:** Mock HTTP client (6-8 hours), Mock Discord state (8-12 hours), Fluent assertions (6-8 hours)
- **Long-term:** Error queue (2-3 hours), Attachment factory (1-2 hours), Pytest fixtures (2-3 hours), Config decorator (1 hour)

**Note:** dpytest is a testing library, not a bridge. These patterns are valuable for improving our test suite quality, speed, and maintainability. The factory pattern and async event runner are particularly valuable for preventing flaky tests.
